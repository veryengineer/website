              <p>Have you ever had an idea that you just knew would help the world?
                 And you got stuck because you couldn't do it on your own, and
                 abandoned it? Welcome to the club.</p>
              <p>The problem is often that we give up. And we shouldn't. Because
                 even if we're facing a hard problem, there is always someone
                 out there that wants to help. People are awesome like that.</p>
              <p>This initiative is dedicated to all the future ideas that will
                 see the light of day and make a change, because we didn't quit.
                 By doing public pilots we will together find a means to help
                 engineers to make their dreams come true. Yes, finding
                 support may seem scary or impossible sometimes; we are going
                 to change that and make it happen, together.</p>

                <p class="text-center">A first pilot aims to design a
                  solar powered scrypt miner to reduce the footprint of
                  cryptocurrency mining for Dogecoin, Litecoin and Digibyte. It will
                  start with a series of introductions across Github, Twitter and
                  Reddit. Once there is sufficient interest, design workshops can
                  start using an open, interactive collaborative platforms.</p>
